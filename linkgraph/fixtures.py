"""TEST FIXTURE modeling the real ``candidates.jsonl`` shape -- NOT a claim
about any real, identifiable RFC. Every identifier below uses the ``RFCX``/
``ERRX`` prefix convention (matching ``rag-reliability/syncgate``'s and
``covgate``'s own fixtures): a real RFC citation is *always* exactly ``RFC``
followed by digits, with no letter in between, so ``RFCX<n>`` can never be
mistaken for -- or collide with -- a real, currently-assigned RFC, now or
after any number of future RFCs are issued. Every protocol described
("Widget Transport", "Session Handshake") is invented for this fixture.

An earlier draft of this fixture used plain digit identifiers in the
"9000s" on the assumption that range was unassigned. It was not: the real
RFC index (fetched into ``agentic-rag/data/raw/_cache/rfc-index.txt``) is
dense and sequential up to 10014 with no reliably permanent gaps, so RFC
9010, 9021-9026, and 9030 are real, currently-assigned RFCs (e.g. RFC 9010
is "Routing for RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks)
Leaves", RFC 9021 is "Use of the Walnut Digital Signature Algorithm..." --
nothing like this fixture's invented Widget Transport / Session Handshake
content). Picking "a plausible-looking unused number" is not a reliable
safety property against a corpus assigned by an external authority that
keeps growing; only a non-digit-shaped identifier is permanently safe by
construction, which is why every fictional RFC-like id here is ``RFCX<n>``.
(Real errata IDs are already always purely numeric -- see
``corpus_fetch/fetch_errata.py``'s ``/eid(\\d+)/`` pattern -- so this
fixture's letter-prefixed ``ERRX<n>`` errata ids were never at risk of this
same collision, but use the same prefix convention for consistency.)

The fixture models a genuine small multi-obsoletes pattern shaped like the
real HTTP/1.1 case (RFC 2616 was later obsoleted by six separate RFCs,
7230-7235): a fictional monolithic ``RFCX9010`` is split into six independent
successors (``RFCX9021``-``RFCX9026``), plus a smaller two-successor split
(``RFCX9030`` -> ``RFCX9031``/``RFCX9032``) for a second, independent family,
plus a clarifying ``updates`` edge, three errata, one deliberately DANGLING
obsoletion pointer (``RFCX9022``'s obsoleted-by target, ``RFCX9099``, is
never given its own mention -- modeling a real gap where the ingest has not
yet fetched/emitted a document a real RFC index entry points at), and a
handful of co-mention mentions grouped by ``doc_id`` for the weak
co-occurrence signal.

Each RFC's raw text repeats that RFC's own subject-matter vocabulary
("multiplex"/"framing"/"stream"/"windowing"/"backpressure" for the Widget
Transport family; "handshake"/"certificate"/"cipher"/"nonce"/"attestation"
for the Session Handshake family) -- same technique ``graphrx/fixtures.py``
itself uses to keep a family's facts genuinely coherent and two families
genuinely separable, which ``tests/test_graphrx_handoff.py`` exercises via a
deliberately planted cross-family merge.

Structured ``extra`` (obsoletes/updates/rfc) is attached only to each
entity's own canonical ("-index"/errata) mention, mirroring how a real
RFC-index-derived record would carry that metadata while a plain prose
reference to an already-known entity typically does not -- ``resolve.py``'s
per-mention edge-building (rather than a separate "merge extras" step) is
what makes that split safe: every mention is processed independently and
redundant/duplicate edges are deduped by ``LinkGraph.add_edge``. ``extra``'s
cross-reference lists hold ``RFCX<n>`` strings here (the real contract from
agentic-rag's own connectors uses bare ints, since real RFC numbers are the
correct real-world representation) -- ``resolve.py`` reads them with plain
f-string interpolation, which works identically for either representation,
so this fixture-only divergence needs no production-code change.
